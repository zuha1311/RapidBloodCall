Problem Statement: 
Blood is a life-saving medical exigency in case of emergency needs. However, in case of medical emergenices, patients and hospitals find it difficult to obtain blood instantaneously. especially negative and rare blood types. As of 2016, India has 2760 registered blood banks out of which less than 500 are properly functional. The problem is not due to lcak of donors but due to the lack of accessibility of donors. 
Presently, India’s blood donation system is extremely uneven, with almost no interlinkages. In absence of interaction and connectivity between blood banks, there is ineffective supervision of demand as well as supply in terms of accessibility and value of blood. Most of these issues in Indian blood system pre-exist due to low significance given to blood in our healthcare system, absence of a regulatory structure and insufficient financing in the blood donation related infrastructure.
Current clinical demand for blood is defined as the total number of units of whole blood and components requested/demanded to meet all blood transfusion for emergencies and elective procedures at a defined number of health facilities over a defined period of time (usually one year). The current clinical demand depends on the capacity of the healthcare system. Ideally, all population need for blood should be converted into clinical demand in healthcare facilities. However, this is rarely achieved in low-resource settings, resulting in gaps between the need and demand for blood. In developing countries like India, a greater proportion of population need is presumed to be not met due to several factors such as lack of healthcare access, due to supply and demand-side factors, lack of health infrastructure, clinicians’ knowledge/skills, the health-seeking behaviour of the population etc. (Nanu 2001, Ramani, Mavalankar, and Govil 2009, Choudhury 2011, Lowalekar and Ravichandran 2013).
The current supply of blood is the total number of units of whole blood and components supplied to healthcare facilities, against all requests/demand for blood transfusion over a defined period of time, usually taken as one year. The supply of blood is generally from licensed blood banks or blood storage centres across the country. Ideally, a health care system should address 100% of demand for blood by ensuring uninterrupted supply within its catchment area. However, there exists a gap between clinical demand and supply due to the low volume of voluntary blood donation, lack of awareness, irrational demand, poor supply chain management system etc. (Siromani et al. 2013, Bagcchi 2014, Kurup et al. 2016). According to available estimates, 25% of all maternal deaths are due to haemorrhage (Murthy, Murthy, and Prabhu 2013) and the incidence of post-partum haemorrhage varies from 9.2% to 21% in India (Geller et al. 2008, 6 Yadav K, Namdeo A, and M.A 2013). Reports indicate that 70% of the PPH related deaths are due to lack of immediate availability of blood (Yadav K, Namdeo A, and M.A 2013). Current utilization of blood is the total number of blood units and components utilized by a defined number of healthcare facilities over a defined period, usually one year. There may be a gap between supply and utilization due to wastages, expiry, non-utilization in the health facilities (Far et al. 2014); (Patil, Bhake, and Hiwale 2016).
Objectives : The purpose of this project is to bridge the gap between donor availability and accessibility and provide dynamic location of registered donors. 

The problems with the current systems are as follows:
(i)	Static Location of Donor
The current systems do not take the actual location of the donor into account, while searching them. This problem can be solved if the location of donor is tracked in real-time using GPS and location services. This will allow patients to find donors within their area and will also allow donors to donate blood to the patient in less time by covering less distance. 

(ii)	Privacy Issues
When patients search for donors using the current systems, it displays personal details such as name, mobile number and address to the patient making the donor’s information vulnerable. This problem can be solved by displaying the donor’s information only when she/he has agreed to donate blood to the patient. 

(iii)	Outdated Databases
The current systems usually save information of donors during the time of registration such as age, address, mobile number. However, there are instances when the user’s details are changed. Since the current systems are not real time, it makes the database outdated and ineffective. This problem can be solved by allowing users to update their information and details from within the Application.

(iv)	Lack of communication services between Patient and Donor
The current systems do not provide any sort of communication medium such as chat or call, which can allow the donor to communicate with the requester/patient. This causes a gap between the donor and requester. This problem can be solved by an in-built chatting or calling mechanism within the app. This would allow the donor to communicate and with the requester all in all while maintaining the privacy of the donor. 

(v)	Complex User Interface 
The interface of this application will be designed in such a way that a novice phone or app user will be able to navigate through the application easily. A “Help” section will also be provided for those who find difficulty in accessing the features of the application. 


Our project is being made with the following objectives in mind: 

(i)	Dynamically locating and notifying donors based on patient and donor location in real-time.

(ii)	Maintaining a database of hospitals, clinics and blood banks.

(iii)	Bridging the gap between availability and accessibility of donors.

(iv)	Providing required information in less time and assisting in efficient decision making. 

(v)	Ensuring privacy of user data.
